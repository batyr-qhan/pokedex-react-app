# pokedex-react-app

React Single-Page-App was made by using Ant Design UI, Pokedex API. 

This page shows you a bunch of Pokemon cards and some of their characteristics and main stats. The page also has the feature of pagination (you can set how many cards you want to see per page) and search by name. 

This project was deployed on Heroku and available at: https://pokedex-batyr-app.herokuapp.com/
